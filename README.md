Mobile Application for nonprofit, The Life of Kai

'The Life of Kai' is a non-profit organization that focuses on finding forever homes for homeless dogs. We wanted to create an application that would help locate missing dogs, while fostering community connections. This application will allow dog-owners to create user profiles for their dogs as well as interact with other dog-owners. Reported lost dogs' last locations will display on a map, along with their profile information, and other community members can also report and add markers for sightings of the lost dog.
